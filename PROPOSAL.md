# Intentions:
    
The goal of this project is to create a tool for easy distributed computing. The server will send tasks to connected machines and handle results coming from clients.

# Intended usage:

One machine will be used as a server and will run a program that opens a port. Any number of client machines can connect to that port to join the distributed project.
  
# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

What data structures you will be using and how.
     
What algorithms and /or data structures you will be using, and how.
