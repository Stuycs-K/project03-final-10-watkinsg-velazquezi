# Intentions:
    
The goal of this project is to create a tool for easy distributed computing. The server will send tasks to connected machines and handle results coming from clients.

# Intended usage:

One machine will be used as a server and will run a program that opens a port. Any number of client machines can connect to that port to join the distributed project.
  
# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.
     
How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.
  
What data structures you will be using and how.
     
What algorithms and /or data structures you will be using, and how.

TODO

draft for above: client program, server program, networking, data structures (linked list for list of clients?), networking etc
    
# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project.

1/8/2024 - Finish how the bogus sort works on the clients and makes sure to return the output to the server to test it's end result

1/10/2024 - Baseline implementation of how the server displays the output each client outputs

1/12/2024 - Finish the setup to properly handle how the server deligates the workload onto the different clients and makes sure to recieve the output correctly

1/14/2024 - Display individual client's outputs and possibly have a display feature to view

1/16/2024 - Prepare presentation materials and make sure to have some visuals to describe how our project works and possibily allow others to join the presentation
